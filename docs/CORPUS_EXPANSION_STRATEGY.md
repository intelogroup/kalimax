# Corpus Expansion Strategy: 5,656 ‚Üí 15,000+ Sentences

**Status:** In Progress  
**Current Size:** 5,656 parallel sentences  
**Target Size:** 15,000+ parallel sentences  
**Gap:** 9,344+ sentences needed

---

## Executive Summary

Expanding a medical translation corpus by 3x requires a **multi-pronged approach** combining:
1. **Template-based generation** (provides ~1,000-2,000 sentences)
2. **Paraphrasing & variation** of existing sentences (adds ~2,000-3,000)
3. **Human translation** of new medical content (critical for quality)
4. **Back-translation** augmentation (scalable but needs review)
5. **Data collection** from Haitian medical sources

**Timeline:** 2-6 months depending on resources

---

## Phase 1: Template-Based Generation (Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Created `corpus_expansion_generator.py`
- Generated **138 initial sentences** from 42 templates
- Domains covered:
  - Chronic disease (82 sentences)
  - Mental health (10 sentences)
  - Preventive care (30 sentences)
  - Patient questions (16 sentences)

### üìà Potential
With current approach: **~500-1,000 sentences maximum**
- Templates are finite
- Need to avoid repetitive/unnatural combinations
- Quality decreases with over-generation

**Contribution to goal:** ~1,000 sentences (11% of gap)

---

## Phase 2: Paraphrasing Existing Corpus (Recommended Next Step)

### Strategy
Take existing 5,656 sentences and create **1-2 paraphrases** each focusing on:
- Different registers (formal ‚Üî informal)
- Different phrasings (doctor-speak ‚Üî patient-speak)
- Synonyms and cultural variants

### Example Paraphrasing
**Original:**
- EN: "Take your medication every day"
- HT: "Pran renm√®d ou chak jou"

**Paraphrase 1 (more formal):**
- EN: "You must take your medication daily"
- HT: "Ou dwe pran medikaman ou chak jou"

**Paraphrase 2 (emphatic):**
- EN: "Don't forget to take your medication every single day"
- HT: "Pa bliye pran renm√®d ou chak jou san eksepsyon"

**Paraphrase 3 (patient-friendly):**
- EN: "Remember to take your medicine each day"
- HT: "Sonje pran renm√®d ou tout jou"

### Implementation
```python
# Tool: scripts/generate_paraphrases.py
# Input: 02_corpus.csv (5,656 sentences)
# Process: Generate 1-2 paraphrases per sentence
# Output: 5,000-10,000 additional sentences
# Review required: Yes - human validation essential
```

### Potential Yield
- Conservative (1 paraphrase/sentence): **+5,656 sentences**
- Moderate (1.5 paraphrases/sentence): **+8,484 sentences**  
- Aggressive (2 paraphrases/sentence): **+11,312 sentences**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:** Paraphrases must maintain:
- Cultural appropriateness
- Medical accuracy
- Natural Kreyol phrasing

**Contribution to goal:** ~5,000-8,000 sentences (55-85% of gap)

---

## Phase 3: Targeted Medical Content Translation

### High-Priority Gaps (from analysis)
1. **Chronic Disease Management** (need: 2,000 sentences)
   - Diabetes daily management
   - Hypertension medication adherence
   - Diet and lifestyle counseling

2. **Mental Health** (need: 1,500 sentences)
   - Depression screening (PHQ-9 style questions)
   - Anxiety assessment (GAD-7 style questions)
   - PTSD/trauma-informed care
   - Substance abuse counseling

3. **Women's Health** (need: 1,000 sentences)
   - Family planning
   - Prenatal care dialogues
   - Menstrual health
   - Menopause

4. **Pediatric Care** (need: 800 sentences)
   - Vaccination schedules

   - Parental instructions

5. **Patient Education** (need: 800 sentences)
   - Medication instructions
   - Post-operative care

   - When to seek emergency care

### Sources for Translation
1. **Public health materials**
   - WHO Haiti resources
   - MSPP (Haiti Ministry of Health) documents
   - PIH (Partners In Health) patient education

2. **Standard medical questionnaires**
   - PHQ-9 (depression)
   - GAD-7 (anxiety)
   - AUDIT (alcohol use)
   - Common clinical assessment tools

3. **Medical textbooks/guides**
   - Primary care protocols
   - Emergency medicine guidelines
   - Common chief complaints

### Implementation Approach
```bash
# 1. Collect English source material
# 2. Create translation batches (100-200 sentences)
# 3. Translate with cultural notes
# 4. Native speaker review
# 5. Add to corpus

# Timeline: 2-4 months with dedicated translator
# Cost: Varies (volunteer vs. paid translation)
```

**Contribution to goal:** ~6,000 sentences (65% of gap)

---

## Phase 4: Back-Translation Augmentation

### Concept
Use existing model to translate English medical text ‚Üí Haitian Kreyol, then have human reviewers correct.

### Process
1. Collect 10,000 English medical sentences (easily available)
2. Machine translate EN‚ÜíHT
3. Human review and correction (faster than translation from scratch)
4. Add corrected pairs to corpus

### Advantages
- **Scalable:** Can generate thousands quickly
- **Cost-effective:** Review faster than full translation
- **Diverse:** Can target specific domains easily

### Disadvantages
- **Quality variable:** MT errors need careful review
- **Cultural gaps:** MT may miss cultural nuances
- **Review burden:** Still needs substantial human time

### Realistic Yield
- With good MT model: **+5,000-10,000 sentences** after review
- Timeline: 3-6 months

**Contribution to goal:** ~5,000-10,000 sentences (55-110% of gap)

---

## Phase 5: Data Collection from Haitian Sources

### Natural Kreyol Medical Data
Sources:
1. **Radio transcripts** - Medical call-in shows
2. **Social media** - Health education posts in Kreyol
3. **Clinic notes** - (anonymized, with permission)
4. **Patient forums** - Health questions in Kreyol

### Implementation
```python
# Collect monolingual Kreyol medical text
# Use for:
# 1. Monolingual pre-training (DAPT)
# 2. Back-translate HT‚ÜíEN‚ÜíHT for validation
# 3. Extract common patient phrasings
```

### Ethical Considerations
- ‚úÖ Anonymization required
- ‚úÖ Permission/consent needed
- ‚úÖ Cultural sensitivity paramount

**Contribution to goal:** Improves model quality more than quantity

| **Quality degradation** | High | Strict acceptance criteria; multiple review levels |
| **Timeline slippage** | Medium | Parallel work streams; automate where possible |
| **Budget constraints** | Medium | Prioritize free methods (paraphrasing, templates) |
| **Cultural insensitivity** | High | Native speaker review mandatory; cultural consultant |

---

## Conclusion

Reaching 15,000 sentences is **achievable** but requires a **systematic, multi-method approach**:

1. **Quick wins:** Templates +1,000 (Done this week)
2. **Major push:** Paraphrasing +5,000 (Months 1-2)
3. **Quality content:** Targeted translation +3,000 (Months 2-4)
4. **Scale:** Back-translation +3,000 (Months 3-5)

**Most realistic path:** Focus on **paraphrasing existing corpus** as primary expansion method, supplemented by targeted translation for gap domains.

**Timeline:** 3-6 months with consistent effort  
**Cost:** $0-5,000 depending on approach  
**Result:** High-quality, culturally appropriate Haitian Kreyol medical corpus ready for MT5 training
