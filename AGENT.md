## Budget Tracking

### Month 1 Allocation ($200)
| Category | Budgeted | Spent | Remaining |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| GPU Training | $40 | $0 | $40 |
| Cloud Storage | $5 | $0 | $5 |
| Development Tools | $10 | $0 | $10 |
| Buffer | $145 | $0 | $145 |
| **TOTAL** | **$200** | **$0** | **$200** |

### Cost Optimization Notes
- Prioritizing free tiers and open-source tools in Week 1
- GPU costs will begin in Week 4 with first training runs
- All development environment setup costs are minimal/free

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Current Risks (Week 1)
1. **Technical Setup Delays** - MEDIUM
   - *Mitigation*: Allocate extra time for environment setup, have backup plans for each tool
   
2. **GPU Service Access** - LOW  
   - *Mitigation*: Register with multiple providers (Vast.ai, RunPod, Lambda Labs)
   
3. **Model Download Issues** - LOW
   - *Mitigation*: Test with stable internet, have local backup storage ready

### Mitigation Actions Taken
- None yet (project just starting)

### Upcoming Risk Areas
- Week 4: First GPU training session - cost management critical
- Week 2-3: Data quality validation - expert review needed

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture
- ‚úÖ **Base Model**: NLLB-200-distilled-600M (confirmed superior to M2M-100)
- ‚úÖ **Training Approach**: LoRA fine-tuning with QLoRA quantization  
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: On-demand GPU rentals vs monthly subscriptions
- ‚úÖ **Deployment**: Progressive HF Spaces ‚Üí VPS API approach

### Workflow Decisions
- ‚úÖ **Data Management**: Google Sheets ‚Üí CSV ‚Üí JSON pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation**: Human evaluation-driven iterative improvement
- ‚úÖ **Phase Structure**: Strict 3-phase "Crawl, Walk, Run" approach

### Agent Reflection Notes
*This section is for the agent to track lessons learned and optimization opportunities*

**Current Observations**:
- Project is well-structured with clear phases and realistic budget
- NLLB-200 choice appears well-researched and appropriate
- On-demand GPU strategy should provide significant cost savings
- Expert-driven data curation is a key differentiator

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Consider parallel workstreams where possible to accelerate timeline
- May need to validate GPU rental cost estimates with actual pricing
- Should establish clear success criteria for each week to maintain momentum

**Questions to Address**:
- What specific medical domain translations are highest priority?
- Are there existing English-Haitian Creole datasets to bootstrap from?
- Should we establish connections with Haitian Creole native speakers for validation?
